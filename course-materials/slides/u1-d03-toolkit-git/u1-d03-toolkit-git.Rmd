## Git and GitHub

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git-logo.png")
```
- Git is a version control system -- like “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word, on steroids
- It's not the only version control system, but it's a very popular one
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/github-logo.png")
```
- GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet -- like DropBox but much, much better

- We will use GitHub as a platform for web hosting and collaboration (and as our course management system!)

# Git and GitHub tips

- There are a lot of git commands but 99% of the time you will use git to `add`, `commit`, `push`, and `pull`.

--

- We will be doing Git things and interfacing with GitHub through RStudio and [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com).

--

- There is a great resource for working with git and R: [happygitwithr.com](http://happygitwithr.com/).
