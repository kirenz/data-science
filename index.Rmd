# Welcome {.unnumbered}

The core content of this introductory data science course focuses on data acquisition and wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, inference, modelling, and effective communication of results.

A heavy emphasis is placed on a consistent syntax (with tools from the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)), reproducibility (with [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)), and version control and collaboration (with Git and GitHub).

The goal of the course is to bring students from zero to being able to work in a team on a fully reproducible data science project analysing a dataset of their choice and answering questions they care about.
